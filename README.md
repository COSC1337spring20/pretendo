Pretendo is a Multiplatform NES emulator. It is written in c++ by Evan Teran and Eli Dayan. It was designed to be portable so it is already able to be compiled on several platforms. The current version has been rewritten from scratch in order to focus on quality of emulation. Currently it supports the following features::

* Qt interface is available on all platforms which support it
* Good mapper support (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 32, 33, 34, 40, 41, 43, 46, 48, 50, 57, 58, 61, 64, 66, 68, 69, 71, 75, 76, 79, 86, 90, 113, 118, 144, 159, 163, 180, 201, 206, 218, 226, 228, 231, 232, 240, 241, 242, 243, 245)
* Very accurate per-cycle implementation of CPU
* Very accurate per-cycle implementation of APU
* Very accurate per-cycle implementation of PPU

Binaries will be available on a "once they are ready" basis. We are in no rush to get yet another release out the door. We are currently focusing on code quality and emulation accuracy.
